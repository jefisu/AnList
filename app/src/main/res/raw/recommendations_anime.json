      "content": "Attack on Titan and Gundam are very similar stories at their core: - The main cast are mostly child soldiers. - It's not as simple as good vs. bad; there's a lot of moral ambiguity. - Both stories revolve around the horrors of war. Despite superficially being very different shows that even belong to entirely different genres, it's hard not to see the parallels. If you like a cynical take on political intrigue and conflict, and flawed main characters faced with responsibilities they aren't well-equipped to handle, check out either story. Additionally, there is a lot of attention to the workings of the technology used in these stories, as well as tactics and strategy. Attack on Titan showcases cavalry tactics and the ODM gear its soldiers use, while Gundam explores the intricacies of outer space as a battleground and the workings of its mobile suits. Lastly, mobile suits and Titans are not so different in scale, so I think Attack on Titan captures the feeling of fighting against an enemy that entirely outclasses you in a way that meaningfully complements how Gundam displays the might of its mobile suits.",

      "content": "\"Demon Slayer\" is considered by some to be this generation's version of \"Bleach\" for a reason. Both are fantasy action anime about an organization of people who protect humanity from demons. In both cases, there are several ranks for both the good guys and the bad guys, with the highest ranked getting the most focus after the main characters. Basically, the 13 Court Guard Squad Captains are the Hashira, while the Espada are the Twelve Kizuki. While Ichigo and Tanjiro seem to have nothing in common on the surface, and indeed they are very, very different, they do have one major thing in common- they're both very protective older brothers, with the reason they became a Soul Reaper/Demon Slayer being to protect their younger sister(s). They also have much simpler goals than a usual shounen protagonist- Ichigo just wants to save and protect as many people as he can while Tanjiro just wants to cure his sister, with his revenge against Muzan being more of a side thing. I think \"Bleach\" is better, due to having more complexity to its story and characters, but that's just me. In any case, both are well worth watching if you enjoy this kind of anime.",

However, while Nezuko and Miyuki have more-or-less the same personality (minus the brother complex in Nezuko's case), Tanjiro and Tatsuya are almost completely different, with Tatsuya being much colder, more cynical and ruthless than Tanjiro. They also have several of the same voice actors (Inosuke and Masaki are voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Mitsuri and Mayumi are voiced by Kana Hanazawa, Shinobu and Miyuki are voiced by Saori Hayami, Sanemi and Katsuto are voiced by Kaiji Tang, Akaza and Zhou are voiced by Lucien Dodge, Enmu and Mikihiko are voiced by Landon McDonald, Kaigaku and Tatsuya are voiced by Alejandro Saab etc.). Basically, if you're one of those people who were put off by some of the controversial elements of \"The Irregular at Magic High School\", then \"Demon Slayer\" should make for an adequate substitute.",

      "content": "Oh, where to begin? Both are dark fantasy shounen action anime that revolve around an organization of people who protect humanity from demons (in \"D.Gray-man\", they're called Akuma, but it's the same basic thing). They both have four main characters, three boys and one girl, all of whom are similar to each other: Allen=Tanjiro===> Scarred, kind-hearted 15-year-old boys who show sympathy even for the demons of the series and give a whole new meaning to \"killing with kindness.\" Lenalee=Nezuko===> Yamato nadeshikos who fight primarily using kicks, are very protective of their \"family\" and have an extremely protective older brother. Kanda=Inosuke===> Dumbest and rudest of the four, very arrogant and short-tempered and frequently pick fights with allies and enemies alike. Lavi=Zenitsu===> Bipolar, sleep often and wield lightning-based attacks. Additionally, in terms of role, the Demon Slayer Corps is the Black Order, the Twelve Kizuki are the Noah Family and Muzan himself is the Millennium Earl. Both anime also take injuries seriously, in that if someone breaks a bone, they're not going to be fine after only a day or two. Additionally, \"Demon Slayer\"'s \"The Song of Tanjiro Kamado\" draws a few cues from \"D.Gray-man\"'s \"The 14th Song\". While I can't say for certain, since \"Demon Slayer\" is still ongoing, so far I'd say both shows are equally good, with \"D.Gray-man\" having a better story, and \"Demon Slayer\" having better visuals and music. Basically, if you've watched one, you should definitely watch the other.",

Fukumenki Noise If you are one of those who likes insertion songs more, you will love this anime. Also in the openings, endings, OST, etc. \"Kessoku band\" has made me feel what at first made me feel \"in NO hurry to shout;\" back in the distant 2017. The plots are somewhat different, but in both animes they represent very well, for example, the nervousness in live concerts, or what happens behind the scenes. Both female protagonists have their own personal problems that they will solve with the passing of the chapters. Although Fukumenki Noise is a shoujo unlike the characteristic \"moe\" of Bocchi the rock, it is a work that deserves to be seen, because if you have loved Bocchi the Rock with their respective songs, you are going to love Fukumenki Noise by same way. \"that band\" by kessoku band \"high school\" by in NO hurry to shout; My favorite songs from these bands.",

An additional plus is that Hiroyuki Sawano is responsible for the music in both series. There are differences, and the most visible is that in the case of SNK we are dealing with a technological regress, the world presented inside the walls is more like the previous centuries. 86, where the main species is mecha. The future is shown, and the technology is at a high level.",

Avilio is around 10 years old, and Thorfinn is even younger, 6 years old. When their formative years are so deeply traumatizing, they are consumed with nothing except carrying out revenge (lack of socialization does not help). However, 91 days is more drawn out - a cinematic masterpiece filled with metaphors and literary imagery. It has a more complex script than Vinland Saga, given that it's about the mafia. Both are fantastic and I highly recommend watching. Depending on your mood, you may want to start with Vinland Saga first if you are interested in adventure, revenge elements, and a redemptive storyline (more interesting support characters). If you enjoy psychological mysteries, historic settings, and a sombre reflection on life for a rainy day - 91 days will definitely be more up your alley, physically and metaphorically!",

Both struggle through great tragedy, which forces their characters to develop quickly as a result. Both these animes will leave a lasting impression on you. David and Akira are wonderfully written characters whose stories share similar undertones and ends. The main difference between those shows is that both shows' settings differ quite a bit. As do the situations which cause their hardships.",
